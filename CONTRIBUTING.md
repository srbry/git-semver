## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add support for pre-releases

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add support for pre-releases. Sometimes it is useful to bump pre-release versions
> without doing a full release.

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - There are no spelling mistakes
  - It reads well
  - For english language contributions: Has a good score on
    [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway
    App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

  - We aim to be easy to use
  - We aim to always include a no-configuration option to use the tool
  - Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source
    community.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will
remove things that do not respect it.
